# Python Tasks Repository

This repository contains two Python scripts:

- **Task 1:**
- In this, we took a number as input from user and stored in variable num. Then we simply added a if-else statement to check whether if number is even and odd and printed the output accordingly.
- 
- **Task 2:** [Brief description of Task 2]
In this, we used for loop and range function to iterate numbers from 1 to 50 and took a variable sum and added each iterated number to it and finally printed the result.
