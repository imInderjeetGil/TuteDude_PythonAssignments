# Python Tasks Repository

This repository contains two Python scripts:

- **Task 1:**
- In this, we first took 2 numbers as inputs ( by converting them to int) and stored in num1 and num2 variables. Then we print results with each operations accordingly.
- **Task 2:**
- In here, we simply took 2 inputs from user f_name and l_name and print the required result using formatted string.
