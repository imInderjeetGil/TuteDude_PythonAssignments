# Python Tasks Repository

This repository contains two Python scripts and 2 text files:

- **Task 1:**
  In this, i first created a student_dict dictionary with 5 students( names as keys and marks as values ). Then in the try block i took input student's name and output the value accordingly. If input does not match any key then printed a message Student not found.
  
- **Task 2:**
  In this, i first created an empty list and then extended it with range function values from 1 to 10. Then sliced the list into another list variable and reversed it. Finally printed the original, extracted and reversed list.
